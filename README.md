Kode 8 - RWD Bootstrap
======================


This is a Bootstrap leveraging **Foundation 5, Gulp, Browserify** and a host of other Gulp task runners such as Bourbon Mixins, Uglify, BrowserSync, SASS, JSHint, Source Maps, Source Maps for SCSS and Chrome, and Modernizr.

I've also included some Bower Components such as jQuery 1 and 2, jQuery Easing, Waypoints, Picturefill, Scroll Reveal. You may never use these but I like to include them as I personally use them a lot.

This should help you get up and running with any new web project it minutes.
